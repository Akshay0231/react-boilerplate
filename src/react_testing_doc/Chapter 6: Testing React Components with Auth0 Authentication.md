# Chapter 6: Testing React Components with Auth0 Authentication

## 6.1 Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore how to test React components that use Auth0 for authentication and authorization. Auth0 is a popular authentication platform that enables developers to add secure authentication and authorization features to their applications. We'll cover the strategies for handling authentication and user roles in unit tests, as well as techniques for mocking Auth0 authentication in a test environment. Additionally, we'll learn how to test components based on user roles and permissions.

## 6.2 Handling Authentication and Authorization in Unit Tests

Testing React components that involve authentication and authorization requires special consideration. Auth0 authentication typically involves API calls to verify user credentials, obtain tokens, and manage user sessions. In unit tests, we want to avoid making actual API calls and instead use mock data or simulate the authentication process.

Here's a simple example of a React component that handles authentication using Auth0:

```javascript
// components/Profile.js

import React from 'react';
import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react';

const Profile = () => {
  const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuth0();

  return (
    <div>
      {isAuthenticated ? (
        <div>
          <h2>Welcome, {user.name}</h2>
          <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>Please log in to view your profile.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Profile;
```

To test this component, we'll need to mock the `useAuth0` hook and provide fake user data to simulate the authentication state.

```javascript
// __tests__/components/Profile.test.js

import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Auth0Provider } from '@auth0/auth0-react';
import Profile from '../../components/Profile';

jest.mock('@auth0/auth0-react');

describe('Profile Component', () => {
  it('should display profile information when the user is authenticated', () => {
    const mockUser = {
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john@example.com',
    };

    // Mock the Auth0Provider
    const Auth0ProviderMock = ({ children }) => (
      <div>
        {children}
      </div>
    );

    Auth0Provider.mockReturnValue(Auth0ProviderMock);

    // Mock the useAuth0 hook
    const useAuth0Mock = () => ({
      isAuthenticated: true,
      user: mockUser,
    });

    useAuth0.mockReturnValue(useAuth0Mock);

    render(
      <Auth0Provider>
        <Profile />
      </Auth0Provider>
    );

    const welcomeElement = screen.getByText(/Welcome, John Doe/i);
    expect(welcomeElement).toBeInTheDocument();

    const emailElement = screen.getByText(/Email: john@example.com/i);
    expect(emailElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should display a message to log in when the user is not authenticated', () => {
    // Mock the useAuth0 hook
    const useAuth0Mock = () => ({
      isAuthenticated: false,
    });

    useAuth0.mockReturnValue(useAuth0Mock);

    render(
      <Auth0Provider>
        <Profile />
      </Auth0Provider>
    );

    const loginMessageElement = screen.getByText(/Please log in to view your profile./i);
    expect(loginMessageElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

In the above tests, we mock the `useAuth0` hook to return the desired authentication state (authenticated or not) and user data. We use `screen.getByText()` to check if the component renders the correct content based on the authentication state.

**Expert's Note:** When testing components with Auth0 authentication, ensure to cover scenarios where the user is both authenticated and unauthenticated. Also, consider testing edge cases, such as handling loading states or error conditions during the authentication process.

## 6.3 Strategies for Mocking Auth0 Authentication and User Roles

Mocking Auth0 authentication and user roles can be achieved by providing custom implementations for the Auth0 authentication SDK and user roles management functions. Let's consider a component that handles user roles and permissions:

```javascript
// components/RestrictedComponent.js

import React from 'react';
import { withAuthenticationRequired } from '@auth0/auth0-react';
import { useHasUserRole } from '../utils/auth';

const RestrictedComponent = () => {
  const isAdmin = useHasUserRole('admin');

  return (
    <div>
      {isAdmin ? (
        <h2>Admin Only Component</h2>
      ) : (
        <p>Sorry, you do not have permission to view this component.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default withAuthenticationRequired(RestrictedComponent);
```

In this example, we use a custom hook `useHasUserRole` from `utils/auth` to check if the authenticated user has the "admin" role. To test this component, we'll need to mock the `useHasUserRole` function and simulate different user roles.

```javascript
// __tests__/components/RestrictedComponent.test.js

import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Auth0Provider } from '@auth0/auth0-react';
import RestrictedComponent from '../../components/RestrictedComponent';

jest.mock('@auth0/auth0-react');
jest.mock('../../utils/auth');

describe('RestrictedComponent', () => {
  it('should display the admin-only component when the user has the "admin" role', () => {
    // Mock the useHasUserRole function to return true for "admin" role
    useHasUserRole.mockReturnValue(true);

    // Mock the Auth0Provider
    const Auth0ProviderMock = ({ children }) => (
      <div>
        {children}
      </div>
    );

    Auth0Provider.mockReturnValue(Auth0ProviderMock);

    render(
      <Auth0Provider>
        <RestrictedComponent />
      </Auth0Provider>
    );

    const adminComponentElement = screen.getByText(/Admin Only Component/i);
    expect(adminComponentElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should display a message for users without the "admin" role', () => {
    // Mock the useHasUserRole function to return false for "admin" role
    useHasUserRole.mockReturnValue(false);

    // Mock the Auth0Provider
    const Auth0ProviderMock = ({ children }) => (
      <div>
        {children}
      </div>
    );

    Auth0Provider.mockReturnValue(Auth0ProviderMock);

    render(
      <Auth0Provider>
        <RestrictedComponent />
      </Auth0Provider>
    );

    const permissionMessageElement = screen.getByText(/Sorry, you do not have permission to view this component./i);
    expect(permissionMessageElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

In the above tests, we mock the `useHasUserRole` function to return different values for the "admin" role. We use `screen.getByText()` to verify that the component behaves as expected based on the user role.

**Expert's Note:** When mocking Auth0 authentication and user roles, ensure to test scenarios where users have different roles and permissions. Additionally, consider testing how the component behaves for users with multiple roles or no roles at all.

## 6.4 Testing Components Based on User Roles and Permissions

Testing components based on user roles and permissions involves verifying that the component

 renders the correct content and behavior based on the user's roles. We've already seen examples of testing components with different user roles in the previous section. Here's a summary of the approach:

1. Mock the necessary Auth0 authentication functions and user roles management functions.
2. Set up different scenarios for user roles (e.g., admin, user, guest) using the mocked functions.
3. Render the component and check if it displays the expected content based on the user's role.

Testing components based on user roles is essential for ensuring that your application behaves correctly and securely based on the user's permissions.
