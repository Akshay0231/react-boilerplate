#<a name="_n1r0cm7nen0f"></a>Redux, React-Redux, and Redux-Toolkit

`     `Redux, React-Redux, and Redux-Toolkit are all related libraries used in modern web development, particularly with the React library.
# <a name="_w92tfgh82aqz"></a>Basic Introduction
## <a name="_ngnkhwzhkx9e"></a>Redux 
`  `Redux is a state management library that is designed to help developers manage the state of their applications in a predictable and efficient way. It provides a centralised store that holds the state of an entire application, and all updates to that state are made through a series of actions.
## <a name="_7vonq6fvhlle"></a>React-Redux
React-Redux is a library that provides bindings between React and Redux. It allows developers to connect their React components to the Redux store and efficiently manage the application state, making it easier to build large-scale applications.
## <a name="_jt2xv58bik00"></a>Redux-Toolkit
Redux-Toolkit is a library that provides a set of utilities and helpers that simplify the process of working with Redux. It includes tools for creating reducers, actions, and selectors, as well as middleware for handling common tasks such as API requests and caching.

Together, these libraries provide a powerful set of tools for building complex and scalable web applications. Redux provides a predictable and efficient way to manage application state, while React-Redux and Redux-Toolkit make it easier to use Redux with the React library.

# <a name="_gm1xd9xdk5tw"></a>Architecture and Concepts
## <a name="_p9b2pqidxbuh"></a>Redux
- Redux follows a unidirectional data flow architecture, which means that data flows in a single direction in the application. 
- The data is stored in a single centralised store, and all changes to the state are made through dispatching actions. 
- The store holds the current state of the application and provides a set of methods to access and modify the state.
### <a name="_85q2ce6um7s8"></a>Fundamental Concepts
The Redux architecture is based on three fundamental concepts:
#### 1.  <a name="_4vygqja10ok4"></a>Actions: 
`  `Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened in the application. They carry a payload of information that describes the changes made to the state.
#### 2. <a name="_d54iphsoulr5"></a>Reducers: 
`  `Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action and return a new state. They do not modify the existing state but instead create a new state based on the changes specified in the action.
#### 3. <a name="_fai4rx8mwr9z"></a>Store: 
`  `The store is a single, centralised object that holds the state of the entire application. It provides a set of methods to read and update the state and dispatch actions to modify the state.

## <a name="_rh1v15of5y8s"></a>React-Redux:
### <a name="_f1pmyr7hqqmh"></a>Analogy wrt redux
- React-Redux is based on the same architecture and concepts as Redux. It provides a set of bindings between React components and the Redux store, making it easier to manage application state in a React application.
### <a name="_qtoltuk7y74z"></a>Core Concepts:
-  <a name="_2ekd1vxgcn5j"></a>The core concept of React-Redux is the Provider, which is a React component that allows any component in the component tree to access the Redux store. 
-  <a name="_1uh4m2ltsyr6"></a>The Provider component is wrapped around the entire component tree in the application, and any component that needs to access the store can use the connect function to connect to the store.
-  <a name="_oaccp4tl9fen"></a>React-Redux also provides a set of hooks, such as useSelector and useDispatch, that make it easier to access the store and dispatch actions from within functional components.

## <a name="_du3csv61f92b"></a>Redux-Toolkit
- Redux-Toolkit is built on top of Redux and provides a set of utilities and helpers that simplify the process of working with Redux.
- ` `It includes tools for creating reducers, actions, and selectors, as well as middleware for handling common tasks such as API requests and caching.
### <a name="_5qjico5ho1js"></a>Core Concepts:
The core concepts of Redux-Toolkit include:

1. createSlice()	A function that generates a slice of the Redux state, including the reducer function and a set of action creators.
1. createAsyncThunk()
   A function that generates an action creator for handling asynchronous operations, such as API requests.
1. createSelector()
   A function that creates a memoized selector function for efficiently computing derived data from the Redux state.
1. configureStore()
   A function that creates a Redux store with default middleware and configuration options, including support for DevTools and hot reloading.

These concepts make it easier to write concise and maintainable Redux code, with less boilerplate and configuration required.


# <a name="_dt39xregn5dv"></a>Ease of use
## <a name="_6cyt57ejsn6v"></a>**Redux**
-  <a name="_99175eyeh0iq"></a>Redux is the most difficult to use among the three, but it provides the most flexibility. 
-  <a name="_aopgalz0ik4v"></a>It requires you to define your own reducers, actions, and selectors, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. 
-  <a name="_ymtzo2l5jk7t"></a>However, this flexibility allows you to create a custom state management solution that fits your specific needs.
## <a name="_wfd4j0x23mbj"></a>**React-redux**
-  <a name="_elukz2ma147m"></a>React-Redux is easy to use, but it requires a bit more setup than Redux-Toolkit. 
-  <a name="_32e01gpo0cvg"></a>It requires you to wrap your application in a "Provider" component and use the "connect" function to connect your components to the Redux store. 
-  <a name="_ars1i4szkjt"></a>While this may seem like extra work, it provides a clear separation of concerns between your UI components and your state management code.
## <a name="_wbhxdei9fj0b"></a>**Redux-toolkit**
-  <a name="_5tvclorelwk3"></a>In terms of ease of use, Redux-Toolkit is the easiest to use among the three. 
-  <a name="_npx6wl8oeja1"></a>It provides a set of tools that simplify the process of creating Redux stores, reducers, actions, and selectors. 
-  <a name="_p57wyaxnovqt"></a>It also provides a standardised way of defining reducers using the "createSlice" function, which eliminates the need to write boilerplate code.
## <a name="_7gwse3gtpv2"></a>Summary
-  <a name="_o9vm7srgaokc"></a>If you're looking for an easy-to-use solution for state management in a React application, Redux-Toolkit is the best choice. 
-  <a name="_h4sqmsyb98ef"></a>If you're already using Redux and want to integrate it with React, React-Redux is a good option. 
-  <a name="_hnq6rnrmohez"></a>If you need the flexibility to create a custom state management solution, Redux is the way to go.

# <a name="_8s17qeb0ix4w"></a>Developer Experience (DX)
`	`Redux, React-Redux, and Redux-Toolkit all aim to provide a good developer experience (DX) when working with state management in a React application, but each has its own strengths and weaknesses.
## <a name="_t63hz0ojdus3"></a>Redux
- Redux provides a simple and flexible API for managing state, but its developer experience can be more complex compared to other options. 
- Developers need to write code to set up the Redux store, reducers, and actions, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. 
- However, once set up, Redux provides a clear separation of concerns between UI and state management.
## <a name="_3nyv0grq2f33"></a>React-redux
- React-Redux provides a smoother DX than plain Redux. 
- It simplifies the process of connecting React components to the Redux store by providing the "connect" function and the "Provider" component. 
- This abstraction layer provides a cleaner and more intuitive way to manage state in a React application. 
- It also has a more React-like API, which makes it easier for developers to work with.
## <a name="_hricr888v071"></a>React-toolkit
- Redux-Toolkit is designed to provide a more streamlined DX for using Redux with React. 
- It includes a set of utilities and helpers that simplify the process of setting up the Redux store, defining reducers, and creating actions. 
- The "createSlice" function, in particular, makes it easier to create and manage reducers, eliminating boilerplate code. 
- Redux-Toolkit also provides a set of middleware and enhancers that can help improve performance and debugging.
## <a name="_7lmcd41jn7ss"></a>Summary
- Redux is the most flexible but may have a steeper learning curve.
- React-Redux provides a smoother DX than plain Redux.
- Redux-Toolkit provides a streamlined DX specifically for working with Redux and React. 
- Which option to choose depends on your development needs, preferences, and the complexity of your application.


# <a name="_zggzbpe7n5g9"></a>Performance
`	`In terms of performance, Redux, React-Redux, and Redux-Toolkit all have a minimal performance overhead, and the choice between them is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall performance of your application.
## <a name="_z3zf9gs5ckqc"></a>Redux
- Redux is a simple library that mainly provides a way to manage application state, and it does not have any significant performance overhead.
- ` `However, the way you write your reducers and selectors can have a significant impact on the performance of your application.
## <a name="_w5y7o4rs8rlg"></a>React-redux
- React-Redux also has a minimal performance overhead. 
- The "connect" function that is used to connect React components to the Redux store uses a shallow comparison to determine whether to update the props of the connected components. 
- This means that only the components that need to be updated are rerendered, which can help improve the performance of your application.
## <a name="_xh51los807ky"></a>Redux-toolkit
- Redux-Toolkit is designed to help improve the performance of your Redux application by providing a set of middleware and enhancers. 
- For example, the "redux-thunk" middleware can help optimise asynchronous actions by allowing them to be dispatched as plain functions, while the "redux-logger" middleware can help with debugging performance issues.
## <a name="_4d0kjer3eyzk"></a>Summary
- In summary, all three libraries have minimal performance overhead, and the choice between them is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall performance of your application. 
- However, Redux-Toolkit includes a set of tools that can help improve the performance of your application and make it easier to debug performance issues.


# <a name="_n6qeemndose2"></a>Scalability & Flexibility
## <a name="_buzf3vpwan9m"></a>Redux
- Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. 
- It provides a way to manage the state of an application in a single location, called the store, which allows for more predictable and easier-to-debug code. 
- Redux is highly scalable as it provides a standardised way of managing the state, making it easier to reason about the application's behaviour as it grows in complexity. 
- However, it requires a fair amount of boilerplate code to set up, which can make it less flexible.
## <a name="_qe9kmluj4foc"></a>React-redux
- React-Redux is a library that provides bindings between Redux and React. 
- It simplifies the process of connecting a React component to the Redux store by providing a set of helper functions that abstract away some of the boilerplate. 
- React-Redux can be highly flexible since it allows for different ways of connecting components to the store, but it still relies on Redux for state management, which can limit flexibility in certain cases.
## <a name="_lt45h5bcwj1g"></a>Redux-toolkit
- Redux Toolkit is a package that simplifies the process of writing Redux code by providing a set of utilities that abstract away some of the boilerplate. 
- It includes features such as creating "slices" of the store that group related reducers and actions together, creating thunks for handling asynchronous logic, and creating a "createSlice" function that generates Redux code automatically. 
- Redux Toolkit is highly flexible and scalable, as it provides a standardised way of managing state while also being more approachable for developers who are new to Redux.


# <a name="_6rx46728r85"></a>Integration with React and other Libraries 
## <a name="_wll18kms61tq"></a>Redux & react-redux
Integration of React with Redux involves creating a store, defining actions, and mapping state and actions to props. Here are the steps you can follow to integrate React with Redux:

1. Install the necessary packages using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install redux react-redux
```

2. Create a Redux store. You can create a store by importing the createStore function from the redux package and passing it a reducer function:

```js

import { createStore } from 'redux';

const reducer = (state = {}, action) => {
   // define your state and actions here
   return state;
};

const store = createStore(reducer);
```

3. Wrap your React app in a <Provider> component. The <Provider> component makes the Redux store available to all components in your app:

```js

import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

ReactDOM.render(
   <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
   </Provider>,
   document.getElementById('root')
);

```

4. Connect your components to the Redux store using the connect() function. This function takes two arguments: mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps. mapStateToProps maps state from the store to props in your component, and mapDispatchToProps maps actions to props in your component:

```js

import { connect } from 'react-redux';

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
   return {
   // map state to props here
      };
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
   return {
   // map actions to props here
   };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent);

```

`	`Once you have set up your Redux store and connected your components to the store, you can use the state and actions in your components as props. For example, you can access the state like this:

```js
const MyComponent = ({ myState }) => {
   return <div>{myState}</div>;
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
   return {
      myState: state.myState
   }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(MyComponent);
```
And you can dispatch actions like this:

```js

const MyComponent = ({ myAction }) => {
   return 
      <button onClick={myAction}>
         Click me
      </button>
}

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
   return {
      myAction: () => {
         dispatch({ type: 'MY_ACTION' })
      }
   }
}

export default connect(null, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent);
```

## <a name="_8gc78xp6pqcz"></a>Redux-toolkit Integration
Integration with React and other libraries like Redux Toolkit can be done in several steps. Here's a general overview of how you can integrate Redux Toolkit with a functional component in React:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
- redux and react-redux for integrating Redux with React.
- @reduxjs/toolkit for using Redux Toolkit.

You can install these dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
   npm install redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit
```

2. Create a Redux store using Redux Toolkit. You can create a store by using the configureStore() function provided by Redux Toolkit:

```js

import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = configureStore({
   reducer: rootReducer,
});

export default store;
```

   Here, rootReducer is a combination of all your reducers.

3. Wrap your React application with the Provider component from react-redux. This makes the store available to all the components in your application:

```js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
   <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
   </Provider>,
   document.getElementById('root')
);
```

4. Define your Redux state slices using the createSlice() function provided by Redux Toolkit:

```js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
const counterSlice = createSlice({
   name: 'counter',
   initialState: 0,
   reducers: {
      increment: (state) => state + 1,
      decrement: (state) => state - 1,
   },
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

Here, we have defined a counter slice with an initial state of 0 and two reducers for incrementing and decrementing the counter.

5. Use the useDispatch() hook from react-redux to dispatch actions from your component:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { increment, decrement } from './counterSlice';

function Counter() {

const dispatch = useDispatch();

const counter = useSelector((state) => state.counter);

return (
   <div>
      <p>Counter: {counter}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>-</button>
   </div>
);
}

export default Counter;
```

`  `Here, we have defined a Counter component that uses the useDispatch() hook to dispatch the increment and decrement actions when the user clicks on the respective buttons.

`	`That's it! With these steps, you should now have Redux Toolkit integrated with your React functional component. You can define more slices and reducers to manage other parts of your application state.
